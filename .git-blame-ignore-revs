# When making commits that are strictly formatting/style changes, add the
# commit hash here, so git blame can ignore the change.
# See docs for more details:
# https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile
# 
# You should be able to execute either configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.bat or configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.sh
# to configure git-blame to ignore the following revisions.
#
# Example entries:
# <full commit hash>  # initial black-format
# <full commit hash>  # rename something internal
